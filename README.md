Bit Serial Adder Subtractor FSM
This repository contains the lab report, design files, and simulation results for the Bit Serial Adder Subtractor with an Accumulator System, developed as part of the Digital Systems I course at RIT.

Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Bit Serial Adder Subtractor controlled by a Finite State Machine (FSM). Using 5-bit operands, the system performs serial addition and subtraction, integrating key digital design concepts such as shift registers, two's complement arithmetic, and Boolean algebra.

The project was implemented using Intel Quartus for circuit synthesis and ModelSim for waveform simulation, showcasing practical skills in FPGA-based system design and verification.
